### bonjour ðŸŒ¸

Hey! I'm Sophie, your friendly neighbourhood creative. Iâ€™m pursuing my BSE in software engineering [@uWaterloo](https://github.com/uWaterloo), and I spend my spare code on projects at the intersection of art and tech. I also noodle around making music, build things out of dirt, and create surreal paintings to tickle the senses.

ðŸŒ± currently: design and dev at schoolhouse.world!
