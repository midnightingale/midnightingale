### bonjour ðŸŒ¸

hey! i'm sophie liu, your friendly accessible tech developer and enthusiast. Iâ€™m pursuing my BSE in software engineering [@uWaterloo](https://github.com/uWaterloo), and I spend my spare code on projects at the intersection of art and tech. I also direct marketing at [vhHacks](https://vhhacks.ca/), and create surreal paintings to tickle the senses.
