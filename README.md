### hello friend 🌸

Hey! I'm Sophie, your friendly neighbourhood creative. I studied software engineering @uWaterloo with a specialization in HCI, and I spend my spare code on projects at the intersection of art and tech. I also noodle around making music, building things out of dirt, and creating surreal paintings to tickle the senses.

some highlights: 
- design/product/eng at [schoolhouse.world](https://schoolhouse.world)
- R&D at [christie digital](https://www.christiedigital.com/)
- built an interactive projection art installation, open to the public in a museum :)

you can find my work at [sophie.garden](https://sophie.garden).
