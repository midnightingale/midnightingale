### bonjour ðŸŒ¸

Hey! I'm Sophie, your friendly accessibility developer and creative. Iâ€™m pursuing my BSE in software engineering [@uWaterloo](https://github.com/uWaterloo), and I spend my spare code on projects at the intersection of art and tech. I also directed marketing at vhHacks, noodled around on the frontend team at [Hack the North](https://hackthenorth.com/), and create surreal paintings to tickle the senses.

ðŸŒ± currently: software developer at a stealth startup, making games to teach English to kids!
